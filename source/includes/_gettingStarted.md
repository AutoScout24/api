# Getting Started

The AutoScout24 API provides a RESTful API to write and extract the AutoScout24 content. All API requests use the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resource URLs. JSON is used to represent the responses of the sent HTTP requests. In addition, the JSON responses contain additional hypermedia information of related resources.

The AutoScout24 Vehicle API can be reached via the following base URL: [https://api.autoscout24.com](https://api.autoscout24.com)

Before you can start using the API with your application, youâ€™ll need to register at AutoScout24 and define what type of application you're about to create. Register your application by contacting AutoScout24 via E-Mail <a href="mailto:daten@autoscout24.de?Subject=RESTful%20API%20Access%20Information%20Request" target="_top">daten@autoscout24.de</a>. **While registering your application you need to provide your redirect URL and your scope**. After successful registration AutoScout24 provides you with a unique `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Store these credentials, as you will need them to authenticate your application against the API.
